Designed a decentralized land records system using blockchain to ensure tamper-proof, transparent data storage..
 Structured and validated land ownership data (owner ID, property details) before securely storing it in blocks
 using smart contracts.
 Simulated a secure data pipeline from input to immutable storage, demonstrating core data engineering principles
 like data integrity and lineage.
